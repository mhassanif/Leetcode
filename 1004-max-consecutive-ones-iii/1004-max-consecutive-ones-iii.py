'''
Explanation:
    - left pointer is used to track the start of the window, and right is used to expand the window
    - We increment the right pointer through the array, expanding the window.
    - If we encounter more than k zeros, we move the left pointer (shrink the window) until the number of zeros is within the limit.
    - The variable maxLength keeps track of the maximum length of a valid subarray (where the number of flipped 0s is â‰¤ k).
